I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Automation](https://zdhxy.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/). Currently, my research interest includes reinforcement learning and robotics manipulation.

During my undergraduate studiesï¼Œ I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Beiya Yang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/2023010084) from [School of Computer Science](https://jsj.nwpu.edu.cn/),  Northwestern Polytechnical University. In the future, I will pursue research on embodied intelligence under the supervision of Prof. [Houde Liu](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lhd/main.htm) at the [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS)](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/main.htm), Tsinghua University.
